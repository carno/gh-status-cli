Why?
----

Since I've started using GitHub more often, I encountered seldom problems with
pull/push commands ending with a failure. Of course one can simply check
`GitHub status page`_ , but working with git in the command line, it's simply
quicker for me to check it using command line.

.. _`GitHub status page`: https://status.github.com/

How?
----

Using requests_ python module to query `GitHub status api`_ .

.. _requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
.. _`GitHub status api`: https://status.github.com/api
